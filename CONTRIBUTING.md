# Contributing to Zuku

Zuku is an open-source project released under the (Apache license, version 2.0)
[https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0].  We welcome any and all
contributions.

## How to begin

Most of the time, the best thing is to begin by (opening an issue)
[https://github.com/nv-legate/zuku/issues] for us to address.
If you wish to start development, plase work on a fork of the
repository and open a pull request.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

Zuku is released under the Apache license, version 2.0 and is free to use,
modify, and redistribute.  To ensure that the license can be exercised without
encumbrance, we ask you that you only contribute your own work or work to which you
have the intellectual rights.  To that end, we employ the Developer's Certificate
of Origin (DCO), which is the lightweight mechanism for you to certify that you are
legally able to make your contribution. Here is the full text of the certificate
(also available at (DeveloperCertificate.org)[https://developercertificate.org]).

  Developer Certificate of Origin
  Version 1.1

  Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
  license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

  By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

  (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
      have the right to submit it under the open source license
      indicated in the file; or

  (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
      of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
      license and I have the right under that license to submit that
      work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
      by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
      permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
      in the file; or

  (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
      person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
      it.

  (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
      are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
      personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
      maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
      this project or the open source license(s) involved.

### How Do I Sign the DCO?

Fortunately, it does not take much work to sign the DCO. All you have to do is
"sign-off" all your commits. To sign off on a commit you simply use the
``--signoff`` (or ``-s``) option when committing your changes:

``$ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."``

This will append the following to your commit message:

``Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>``

Please use your real name and a valid email address at which you can be reached.
For legal reasons, we will not be able to accept contributions that use pseudonyms
in the signature.

## Review Process

As we suggested at the beginning of this document, it will be really helpful to
start with an issue unless your proposed change is really trivial.  An issue will
help to save work in the review process (e.g., maybe somebody is already working on
exactly the same thing you want to work on).  After you open your pull request
(PR), there usually will be a community feedback that often will require further
changes to your contribution (the usual open-source process).  Usually, this will
conclude in the PR being merged by a maintainer, but on rare occasions a PR may be
rejected.  This may happen, for example, if the PR appears abandoned (no response
to the community feedback) or if the PR does not seem to be approaching community
acceptance in a reasonable time frame.  In any case, an explanation will always be
given why a PR is closed.  Even if a PR is closed for some reason, it may always be
reopened if the situation evolves (feel free to comment on closed PRs to discuss
reopening them).

## Code Formatting Requirements

Zuku uses pre-commit to format files. Please use (pre-commit)[https://pre-commit.com/]
on commits to format C++ changes.  We hope that the automation of our formatting checks will make it easy to comply
with our coding standards.  If you encounter problems with code formatting,
 please let us know in a comment on your PR.
